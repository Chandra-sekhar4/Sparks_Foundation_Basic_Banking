# Sparks_Foundation_Basic_Banking
This project is a basic banking system web page that allows users to create accounts, transfer funds between accounts, and view account balances. The web page is built using Python, HTML, and CSS.

## How it works
The web page has three main functionalities:

1.Create Account: Users can create an account by entering their name and initial balance.

2.Transfer Funds: Users can transfer funds between accounts by entering the sender's name, the recipient's name, and the amount to transfer.

3.View Account Balance: Users can view their account balance by entering their name.

The data for the banking system is stored in a SQLite database, and the Python Flask framework is used to handle the server-side logic and communicate with the database. HTML and CSS are used to create the web page's user interface.
